The classic use case is to have a **contact us** form.\\n\\n### Option #1 | formspree\\n\\n[formspree](https://formspree.io/) is the most simple way to have a form on any website. This includes Ghost of course! Use the code below and use your own email. In this example we use `youremail@here.com`. formspree will send you an email to confirm your email and you will start to receive your messages.\\n\\n<form method=\\\"POST\\\" action=\\\"https://formspree.io/youremail@here.com\\\">\\n  <div><input type=\\\"email\\\" name=\\\"email\\\" placeholder=\\\"Your email\\\"></div><br>\\n  <div><textarea name=\\\"message\\\" placeholder=\\\"Your message\\\"></textarea></div><br>\\n  <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Send</button>\\n</form>\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nThis is a placeholder text to give context.

This showcase is brought to you by [play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/)\\n\\n\\n### Option #3 | via your CRM\\n\\nMaybe you want something more organised than a simple email. What about having all your messages going thru a CRM?

The attribute `button` indicate to the markdown editor it needs to generate a button.\\n2. The attribute `button-block` makes this button **responsive**. In other words, the button takes all the width available depending on which device the page is viewed.\\n3. The attribute `button-primary` defines the blue **color**. \\n4.

For larger block of code, you can use:\\n\\n```\\n<!-- Overide CSS styles 🔥 📰 -->\\n\\n<style>\\n    \\n    // Menu font size {}\\n    .site-nav {\\n        font-size: 1.4rem;\\n        height: 40px;\\n    }\\n    // Title size {}\\n    h1 {\\n    \\tfont-size: 4.5rem;\\n\\t}\\n     // Title color {}\\n    .post-full-title {\\n        margin: 0;\\n        color: #ffffff;\\n\\t}\\n    // Logo size {}\\n    img.site-logo {\\n    \\tmax-height: 12vw!important;\\n\\t}\\n    // Main image roudness {}\\n    .post-full-image {\\n        border-radius: 0px 0px 6px 6px;\\n\\t}\\n    // Main content section roudness {}\\n    .post-full-content {\\n\\tborder-radius: 6px 6px 0px 0px;\\n\\t}\\n\\n</style>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Redirect trafic to a new page\\n\\nThis is a pure HTML trick. Redirect the trafic from a webpage to another one is useful in cases you want to **rename** a page.\\n\\nFor example you have your old page **A** and your new page **B**. Instead of renaming page **A**, create a new page **B** and use this script on page **A** to redirect trafic on page **B**.\\n\\nThis way, the trafic that is still pointing to  page **A** doesn't break and page **B** show up instead :) \\n\\n```\\nWe moved this page here:\\nhttps://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\\n\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\n      window.location.href = \\\"https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\\\"\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Comments\\n\\nComments are not rendered.

We usually use it to\ncreate a Table of content.\n\n * Footnotes section\n * Code Block\n * Start your trial\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFootnotes\nThis is very practical to reference something in your content [1]. Most people\nuse it when they have a lot of references in their content [2].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCode block\nCode can be presented inline, like this .post-full-header. For larger block of\ncode, you can use:\n\n<!-- Overide CSS styles 🔥 📰 -->\n\n<style>\n    \n    // Menu font size {}\n    .site-nav {\n        font-size: 1.4rem;\n        height: 40px;\n    }\n    // Title size {}\n    h1 {\n    \tfont-size: 4.5rem;\n\t}\n     // Title color {}\n    .post-full-title {\n        margin: 0;\n        color: #ffffff;\n\t}\n    // Logo size {}\n    img.site-logo {\n    \tmax-height: 12vw!important;\n\t}\n    // Main image roudness {}\n    .post-full-image {\n        border-radius: 0px 0px 6px 6px;\n\t}\n    // Main content section roudness {}\n    .post-full-content {\n\tborder-radius: 6px 6px 0px 0px;\n\t}\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRedirect trafic to a new page\nThis is a pure HTML trick. Redirect the trafic from a webpage to another one is\nuseful in cases you want to rename  a page.\n\nFor example you have your old page A  and your new page B. Instead of renaming\npage A, create a new page B  and use this script on page A  to redirect trafic\non page B.\n\nThis way, the trafic that is still pointing to page A  doesn't break and page B \nshow up instead :)\n\nWe moved this page here:\nhttps://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      window.location.href = \"https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\"\n</script>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComments\nComments are not rendered.

It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p><p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.

When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.

Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"</p><p>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p><p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.</p><p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p><p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.</p><p>The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny.

We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.

For the white kitten had been having its\nface washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it\npretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the\nmischief.\n\nThe way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor\nthing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its\nface all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said,\nshe was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying\nto purr — no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.\n\nBut the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so,\nwhile Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half\ntalking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of\nromps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been\nrolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was,\nspread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after\nits own tail in the middle.\n\n‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’ cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving\nit a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ‘Really, Dinah\nought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’\nshe added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a\nvoice as she could manage — and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair,\ntaking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again.\nBut she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to\nthe kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee,\npretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out\none paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it\nmight.\n\n‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if\nyou’d been up in the window with me — only Dinah was making you tidy, so you\ncouldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire — and it\nwants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had\nto leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here\nAlice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to\nsee how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down\nupon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.\n\n‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were\ncomfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I\nwas very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d\nhave deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for\nyourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m\ngoing to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah\nwas washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you!\nWhat’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went\ninto your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open — if you’d\nshut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses,\nbut listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put\ndown the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you?\n\nHow do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every\nbit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking!\n\n‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet.\nYou know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week — Suppose they\nhad saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the\nkitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I\nsuppose, when the day came. Or — let me see — suppose each punishment was to be\ngoing without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go\nwithout fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather\ngo without them than eat them!\n\n‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it\nsounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if\nthe snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it\ncovers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to\nsleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the\nsummer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about — whenever\nthe wind blows — oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of\nworsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods\nlook sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.\n\n‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously.\nBecause, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood\nit: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and\nreally I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came\nwiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend —’ And here I wish I\ncould tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite\nphrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only\nthe day before — all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and\nqueens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they\ncouldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at\nlast to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And\nonce she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear,\n‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’\n\nBut this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend\nthat you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded\nyour arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice\ngot the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for\nit to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said,\nbecause the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held\nit up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was —‘and if you’re\nnot good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House.\nHow would you like that?’\n\n‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my\nideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the\nglass — that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other\nway. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair — all but the bit behind the\nfireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether\nthey’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire\nsmokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too — but that may be only\npretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are\nsomething like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because\nI’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the\nother room.\n\n‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d\ngive you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink — But oh,\nKitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage\nin Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and\nit’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite\ndifferent on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get\nthrough into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things\nin it!\n\nLet’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s\npretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why,\nit’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get\nthrough —’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she\nhardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt\naway, just like a bright silvery mist.\n\nIn another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into\nthe Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there\nwas a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a\nreal one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall\nbe as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact,\nbecause there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun\nit’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’\n\nThen she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old\nroom was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different\nas possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be\nall alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see\nthe back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and\ngrinned at her.\n\n‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as\nshe noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in\nanother moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and\nknees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!\n\n‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of\nfrightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on\nthe edge of the shovel — and here are two castles walking arm in arm — I don’t\nthink they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m\nnearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible —’\n\nHere something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her\nhead just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she\nwatched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.\n‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the\nKing, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious\nLily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the\nfender.\n\n‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by\nthe fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was\ncovered with ashes from head to foot.\n\nAlice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly\nscreaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the\ntable by the side of her noisy little daughter.\n\nThe Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite\ntaken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the\nlittle Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she\ncalled out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the\nvolcano!’\n\n‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he\nthought that was the most likely place to find one.\n\n‘Blew — me — up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind\nyou come up — the regular way — don’t get blown up!’\n\nAlice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at\nlast she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that\nrate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the\nquestion: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her.\n\nSo Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she\nhad lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she\nput him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so\ncovered with ashes.\n\nShe said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the\nKing made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being\ndusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth\nwent on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook\nso with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.\n\n‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting\nthat the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold\nyou! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it —\nthere, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and\nset him upon the table near the Queen.\n\nThe King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice\nwas a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she\ncould find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a\nbottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he\nand the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper — so low, that Alice\ncould hardly hear what they said.\n\nThe King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of\nmy whiskers!’\n\nTo which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’\n\n‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’\n‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’\n\nAlice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book\nout of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took\nhold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began\nwriting for him.\n\nThe poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some\ntime without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he\npanted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this\none a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend —’\n\n‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice\nhad put ‘the White Knight is sliding down the poker.

(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p><p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p><p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p><p>'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)</p><p>Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p><p>Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p><p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p><p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p><p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.</p><p>However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p><p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p><p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p><p>It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p><p>However, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p><hr><p>'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'</p><p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p><p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p><p>'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'</p><p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'</p><p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way?
