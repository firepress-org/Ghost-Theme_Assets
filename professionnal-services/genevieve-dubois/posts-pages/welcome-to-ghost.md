## Getting Started

Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post **formatting** as you write!

Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:

- Item number one
- Item number two
 - sub item a
 - sub item b
- A final item

Prefer using numbers?

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
 - sub item a
 - sub item b
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.

### What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:

![A bowl of bananas]

### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!

> Ghost is your open source content management system (CMS).

### Need some space? 

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.
