first article","slug":"my-first-article","markdown":"If you plan to publish content you may want to use the blog function out of your website. Here a some examples of what you can do.\n\n### Formatting your content\n\nMarkdown is a very simple formatting syntax for you content. Think about the looks these elements: headers, bold, bulleted lists, link, inserting a picture, etc. It was originally designed to be an easy alternative to HTML. It allows everyone to publish web pages with no HTML experience.\n\n### Bold, italic\n\nWho does not love putting **stuff in bold**... *you know what I mean*? \n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://firepress.org/ — it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to go on [FirePress page](http://firepress.org/).\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firepress-org/theme-assets/master/professionnal-services/martine-nadall/images/office-conference.jpg)\n\n### Bullet points\n\n- Item number one\n- Item number two\n - sub item a\n - sub item b\n- A final item\n\n**Prefer using numbers?**\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n - sub item a\n - sub item b\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Quoting\n\nOur eyes can't help it, they love reading quotes!\n\n> At FirePress our mission is to help brands and entrepreneurs to build an outstanding mobile-first website.\n\n---\n\n### Need some space?\n\nThrow 3 dashes `---` on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Button\n\nNeed a clear **Call to Action**?
