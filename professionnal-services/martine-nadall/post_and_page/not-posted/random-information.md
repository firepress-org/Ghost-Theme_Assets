During my last trip around the world, I capture few pictures. Here are my favorites! This is a simple placeholder. These words won’t make any sense and it's fine. The goal here is to focus on the container not on the content.

> **Best practice** — **Export** your pictures with a width of 1280px (*the height does not matter*) in JPG format. **Compress** them with [JPEGmini](http://www.jpegmini.com/app) to ensure your site is stays snappy and load quickly. This is specially important for mobile users (which is now the majority of web traffic. Everyone hates for websites that are too heavy.

## Fancy Stuff

We added the text over these picture in [Keynotes](http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/). The file [portfolio_1280x640.key](https://github.com/firepress-org/themes-content/tree/master/112_readiness/images/_keynote_project) is open to everyone and free to use. It's part of our open source project [theme-content](https://github.com/firepress-org/themes-content). Enjoy!

### Preview albums from one page

Creating a preview is the action of aggregating, "to combine" or to put things together.

When you have many-many-many photos and albums it's a great idea to create **previews** and aggregate your albums into one place. You could have one main page ([like this one](/portfolio/)) where your visitor can preview a picture of each of your albums. 

The same concept apply for videos or podcast. A great example is how Tim Ferris does it for it's [Podcast page](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/).

At the end, the whole idea is to create a natural flow that is it naturel to navigate.

> **Sara's note** — The [content](https://github.com/firepress-org/themes-content) on this page is an example, an opinionated way you could put your content together. See it as a demo. Edit it or delete it and start over. Make it your own!

## Tags

A more advanced concept is to use tags. Maybe you want to filter the way we see your work by 

- #years
- #country
- #style *(i.e. fashion, events,  sports)*
- #agencies
- etc.

Tag allows you to create a feed about a particular topic.

In some case I would use both so there is two ways to search your albums. See how Pascal [use this concept](http://blog.pascalandy.com/trouver-par-tags/) on his personal blog.
