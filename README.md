This is the default **content** we use for all new Ghost installations at FirePress ðŸ”¥ðŸ“°. By doing this extra step for our clients, they can see quickly how their brand new website feels like. As new publishers, they can also understand how itâ€™s made under the hood.

**Content** here means:

- copywriting files (markdown)
- images
- backup files (json)
- infographic file (Keynote, Photoshop)
