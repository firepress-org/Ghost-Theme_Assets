## Licence
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENCE | Version 3, 29 June 2007 | See it [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/GNU-GENERAL-PUBLIC-LICENSE/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

**No matter how I thrust the open source community, I feel it not best practice to**: 

- 1) Use a link that points to a licence written by a third party
- 2) Use licence(s) proposed by GitHub

If any changes happen, how do you know it's still right for you? By using scenario #1 or #2, you could put yourself in a position where you may lose the control of what the licence was supposed to mean at the moment you read it.

I believe everyone should fork the licence they want to use on their own repos. The one I use is [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/GNU-GENERAL-PUBLIC-LICENSE/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Feel free to fork it :)
