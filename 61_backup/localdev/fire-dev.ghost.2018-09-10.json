the basics of [how to use Ghost](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/learn/), it's now time to edit your content seriously.

We build this page as one of the **most exhaustive markdown reference** you can find on the web.

You can create an *absolute* link [like this one](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can create a *relative* link to pages and posts within your [own website](../style-guide/).\\n\\nSometimes you want to have your visitor open a **link into a new tab**.

The beta is [open for you](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/).\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Form\\n\\nThere are many ways to embed a form into your website. The classic use case is to have a **contact us** form.\\n\\n### Option #1 | formspree\\n\\n[formspree](https://formspree.io/) is the most simple way to have a form on any website. This includes Ghost of course! Use the code below and use your own email. In this example we use `youremail@here.com`. formspree will send you an email to confirm your email and you will start to receive your messages.\\n\\n<form method=\\\"POST\\\" action=\\\"https://formspree.io/youremail@here.com\\\">\\n  <div><input type=\\\"email\\\" name=\\\"email\\\" placeholder=\\\"Your email\\\"></div><br>\\n  <div><textarea name=\\\"message\\\" placeholder=\\\"Your message\\\"></textarea></div><br>\\n  <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Send</button>\\n</form>\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nThis is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.\\n\\n### Option #2 | third party service\\n\\nYou can also use a third party service like [Wufoo](https://www.wufoo.com/) or [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/pricing/).\\n\\n<iframe height=\\\"401\\\" allowTransparency=\\\"true\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"width:100%;border:none\\\" src=\\\"https://firepressorg.wufoo.com/embed/zyr0snn1ad9rvs/\\\">\\n</iframe>\\n\\nThis is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site. This showcase is brought to you by [play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/)\\n\\n\\n### Option #3 | via your CRM\\n\\nMaybe you want something more organised than a simple email. What about having all your messages going thru a CRM? [See this example](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/206058268-How-to-create-a-form-with-Airtable) by Airtable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Blockquotes\\n\\nThis is a placeholder text to give context.

The attribute `button` indicate to the markdown editor it needs to generate a button.\\n2. The attribute `button-block` makes this button **responsive**. In other words, the button takes all the width available depending on which device the page is viewed.\\n3. The attribute `button-primary` defines the blue **color**. \\n4.

For larger block of code, you can use:\\n\\n```\\n<!-- Overide CSS styles 🔥 📰 -->\\n\\n<style>\\n    \\n    // Menu font size {}\\n    .site-nav {\\n        font-size: 1.4rem;\\n        height: 40px;\\n    }\\n    // Title size {}\\n    h1 {\\n    \\tfont-size: 4.5rem;\\n\\t}\\n     // Title color {}\\n    .post-full-title {\\n        margin: 0;\\n        color: #ffffff;\\n\\t}\\n    // Logo size {}\\n    img.site-logo {\\n    \\tmax-height: 12vw!important;\\n\\t}\\n    // Main image roudness {}\\n    .post-full-image {\\n        border-radius: 0px 0px 6px 6px;\\n\\t}\\n    // Main content section roudness {}\\n    .post-full-content {\\n\\tborder-radius: 6px 6px 0px 0px;\\n\\t}\\n\\n</style>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Redirect trafic to a new page\\n\\nThis is a pure HTML trick. Redirect the trafic from a webpage to another one is useful in cases you want to **rename** a page.\\n\\nFor example you have your old page **A** and your new page **B**. Instead of renaming page **A**, create a new page **B** and use this script on page **A** to redirect trafic on page **B**.\\n\\nThis way, the trafic that is still pointing to  page **A** doesn't break and page **B** show up instead :) \\n\\n```\\nWe moved this page here:\\nhttps://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\\n\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\n      window.location.href = \\\"https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\\\"\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Comments\\n\\nComments are not rendered.

The attribute button  indicate to the markdown editor it needs to generate a\n    button.\n 2. The attribute button-block  makes this button responsive. In other words,\n    the button takes all the width available depending on which device the page\n    is viewed.\n 3. The attribute button-primary  defines the blue color.\n 4. The attribute button-rounded  define the button's shape.\n\nIn the section below, see the three main attributes  you can chose from to\ncreate the button of your dreams (or kind of ...).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) Button's color\n\nbutton-primary\nFirePress [../style-guide]\n\nbutton-action\nFirePress [../style-guide]\n\nbutton-highlight\nFirePress [../style-guide]\n\nbutton-caution\nFirePress [../style-guide]\n\nbutton-royal\nFirePress [../style-guide]\n\nLight grey\nFirePress [../style-guide]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2) Button's size\n\nbutton-tiny\nFirePress [https://play-with-ghost.com]\n\nbutton-small\nFirePress [https://play-with-ghost.com]\n\nregular size\nFirePress [https://play-with-ghost.com]\n\nbutton-large\nFirePress [https://play-with-ghost.com]\n\nbutton-jumbo\nFirePress [https://play-with-ghost.com]\n\nbutton-giant\nFirePress [https://play-with-ghost.com]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3) Button's shape\n\nbutton-rounded\nFirePress [https://pascalandy.com/blog/now/]\n\nsquare\nFirePress [https://pascalandy.com/blog/now/]\n\nbutton-pill\nFirePress [https://pascalandy.com/blog/now/]\n\nbutton-square\n  [https://pascalandy.com/blog/now/]\n\nbutton-box\n  [https://pascalandy.com/blog/now/]\n\nbutton-circle\n  [https://pascalandy.com/blog/now/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4) Button's icons\n\nbutton-primary with an icon\n  FirePress [/learn]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAnchor\nVery practical when you want to navigate within a big page. We usually use it to\ncreate a Table of content.\n\n * Footnotes section\n * Code Block\n * Start your trial\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFootnotes\nThis is very practical to reference something in your content [1]. Most people\nuse it when they have a lot of references in their content [2].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCode block\nCode can be presented inline, like this .post-full-header. For larger block of\ncode, you can use:\n\n<!-- Overide CSS styles 🔥 📰 -->\n\n<style>\n    \n    // Menu font size {}\n    .site-nav {\n        font-size: 1.4rem;\n        height: 40px;\n    }\n    // Title size {}\n    h1 {\n    \tfont-size: 4.5rem;\n\t}\n     // Title color {}\n    .post-full-title {\n        margin: 0;\n        color: #ffffff;\n\t}\n    // Logo size {}\n    img.site-logo {\n    \tmax-height: 12vw!important;\n\t}\n    // Main image roudness {}\n    .post-full-image {\n        border-radius: 0px 0px 6px 6px;\n\t}\n    // Main content section roudness {}\n    .post-full-content {\n\tborder-radius: 6px 6px 0px 0px;\n\t}\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRedirect trafic to a new page\nThis is a pure HTML trick. Redirect the trafic from a webpage to another one is\nuseful in cases you want to rename  a page.\n\nFor example you have your old page A  and your new page B. Instead of renaming\npage A, create a new page B  and use this script on page A  to redirect trafic\non page B.\n\nThis way, the trafic that is still pointing to page A  doesn't break and page B \nshow up instead :)\n\nWe moved this page here:\nhttps://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      window.location.href = \"https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/early-adopters-plan/\"\n</script>\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComments\nComments are not rendered. It usually used by coders but you might find it\nuseful as well. Open your comment with <!--  and close it with -->.\n\nThis text is used as a placeholder or a tk note. Words that will follow won't\nmake any sense and this is fine.
