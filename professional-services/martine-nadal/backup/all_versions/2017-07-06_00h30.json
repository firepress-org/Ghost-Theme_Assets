The Internet and physical commons are overloaded with abuse and spam.\n\n15/ The 20th century created a new kind of network - market networks. Open AND meritocratic.\n\n16/ Merit in markets is determined by a commitment of resources. The resource is money, a form of frozen and trade-able time.\n\n17/ The market networks are titans. The credit markets. The stock markets. The commodities markets. The money markets. They break nations.\n\n18/ Market networks work where there is a commitment of money. Otherwise they are just mob networks. The applications are limited.\n\n19/ **Until now.**\n\n20/ Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money.\n\n21/ They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, voting systems.\n\n22/ The meritorious are those who work to advance the network.\n\n23/ As society gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants.\n\n24/ It's important to note that blockchains pay in their own coin, not the common (dollar) money of financial markets.\n\n25/ Blockchains pay in coin, but the coin just tracks the work done. And different blockchains demand different work.\n\n26/ Bitcoin pays for securing the ledger. Etherium pays for (executing and verifying) computation.\n\n27/ Blockchains combine the openness of democracy and the Internet with the merit of markets.\n\n28/ To a blockchain, merit can mean security, computation, prediction, attention, bandwidth, power, storage, distribution, content...\n\n29/ Blockchains port the market model into places where it couldn't go before.\n\n30/ Blockchains' open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.\n\n31/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain without a coin just like it's nonsensical to have a market without money.\n\n32/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain controlled by a sovereign, a corporation, an elite, or a mob.\n\n33/ Blockchains give us new ways to govern networks. For banking. For voting. For search. For social media. For phone and energy grids.\n\n34/ Networks governed without kings, priests, elites, corporations and mobs. Networks governed by anyone with merit to the network.\n\n35/ Blockchain-based market networks will replace existing networks. Slowly, then suddenly. In one thing, then in many things.\n\n36/ Ultimately, the nation-state is just a network (of networks).\n\nFIN/ Thank you, Satoshi Nakomoto.

And very inefficient.</p>\n\n<p>14/ Dictatorships are more efficient in war than democracies. The Internet and physical commons are overloaded with abuse and spam.</p>\n\n<p>15/ The 20th century created a new kind of network - market networks. Open AND meritocratic.</p>\n\n<p>16/ Merit in markets is determined by a commitment of resources. The resource is money, a form of frozen and trade-able time.</p>\n\n<p>17/ The market networks are titans. The credit markets. The stock markets. The commodities markets. The money markets. They break nations.</p>\n\n<p>18/ Market networks work where there is a commitment of money. Otherwise they are just mob networks. The applications are limited.</p>\n\n<p>19/ <strong>Until now.</strong></p>\n\n<p>20/ Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money.</p>\n\n<p>21/ They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, voting systems.</p>\n\n<p>22/ The meritorious are those who work to advance the network.</p>\n\n<p>23/ As society gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants.</p>\n\n<p>24/ It's important to note that blockchains pay in their own coin, not the common (dollar) money of financial markets.</p>\n\n<p>25/ Blockchains pay in coin, but the coin just tracks the work done. And different blockchains demand different work.</p>\n\n<p>26/ Bitcoin pays for securing the ledger. Etherium pays for (executing and verifying) computation.</p>\n\n<p>27/ Blockchains combine the openness of democracy and the Internet with the merit of markets.</p>\n\n<p>28/ To a blockchain, merit can mean security, computation, prediction, attention, bandwidth, power, storage, distribution, content...</p>\n\n<p>29/ Blockchains port the market model into places where it couldn't go before.</p>\n\n<p>30/ Blockchains' open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.</p>\n\n<p>31/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain without a coin just like it's nonsensical to have a market without money.</p>\n\n<p>32/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain controlled by a sovereign, a corporation, an elite, or a mob.</p>\n\n<p>33/ Blockchains give us new ways to govern networks. For banking. For voting. For search. For social media. For phone and energy grids.</p>\n\n<p>34/ Networks governed without kings, priests, elites, corporations and mobs. Networks governed by anyone with merit to the network.</p>\n\n<p>35/ Blockchain-based market networks will replace existing networks. Slowly, then suddenly. In one thing, then in many things.</p>\n\n<p>36/ Ultimately, the nation-state is just a network (of networks).</p>\n\n<p>FIN/ Thank you, Satoshi Nakomoto. And to all the shoulders that Satoshi stands upon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>source</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ Blockchains will replace networks with markets.</p>&mdash; Naval Ravikant (@naval) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/877467629308395521\">June 21, 2017</a></blockquote>  \n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><br><a href=\"/news/services/\" class=\"button button-block button-primary button-rounded\"><i class=\"fa fa-bolt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> See our services</a><br></p>","amp":null,"image":"/news/content/images/2017/07/blockchain.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2017-07-06 04:03:44","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-06 04:18:00","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2017-07-06 04:03:00","published_by":1}],"users":[{"id":1,"uuid":"3fcce7c7-d475-4795-9008-27307ef2ce2e","name":"Martine Nadal","slug":"martine-nadal","password":"$2a$10$TaGBw1W0EPzRx5tq861zX.rVRNk9wM5HyOIDMbJSfFSTRi0S8Ki2S","email":"relations@firepress.org","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firepress-org/theme-assets/master/professional-services/martine-nadal/images/core-author-profile.jpg","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firepress-org/theme-assets/master/professional-services/martine-nadal/images/main-header-blurry.jpg","bio":"I help businesses to focus their marketing efforts with dedication and passion.
