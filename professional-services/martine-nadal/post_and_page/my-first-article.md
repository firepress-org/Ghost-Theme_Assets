If you plan to publish content you may want to use the blog function out of your website. Here a some examples of what you can do. Let's start!

### Formatting your content

Markdown is a very simple formatting syntax for you content. Think about the looks these elements: headers, bold, bulleted lists, link, inserting a picture, etc. It was originally designed to be an easy alternative to HTML. It allows everyone to publish web pages with no HTML experience.

### Bold, italic

Who does not love putting **stuff in bold**... *you know what I mean*? 

### Links

Paste in a URL, like http://firepress.org/ â€” it'll automatically be linked up. You can also customise your anchor text, like this > [FirePress page](http://firepress.org/).

### What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

### Bullet points

- Item number one
- Item number two
 - sub item a
 - sub item b
- A final item

**Prefer using numbers?**

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
 - sub item a
 - sub item b
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it
