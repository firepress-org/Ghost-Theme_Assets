So you can\nadd the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add\na bunch of related tags which are less important.\n\nNews, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports\n\nIn this example, News  is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme,\nbut the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their\nrespective archives.\n\nPrivate tags\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't\nnecessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In\nGhost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\n\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want\nyour theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more\nspace for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use\nprivate tags to tell your theme what to do.\n\nNews, Cycling, #video\n\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and \nCycling  - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with\n #video.\n\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them\nspecial formatting:\n\n{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=\"#video\"}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n\n\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation [https://themes.ghost.org/].","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-08-03 01:22:37","created_by":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","updated_at":"2017-08-03 21:49:43","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-08-03 01:22:41","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null},{"id":"59827ade4fed7f002f6c29fd","uuid":"d079a675-88bc-4bcb-8f33-937c90975125","title":"Using the Ghost editor","slug":"the-editor","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"If you are consider building your next website with a CMS like Wordpress, Drupal, Jekyll or a website builder like Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, I believe you should consider Ghost as a solution to create your website and you blog.

You won't even need to register.\\n\\nGhost uses a language called **Markdown** to format text.\\n\\nWhen you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.\\n\\nAt the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible.

You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.\\n\\n\\n## Formatting text\\n\\nThe most common shortcuts are of course, **bold** text, _italic_ text, and [hyperlinks](https://example.com). These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.\\n\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + B` for Bold\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + I` for Italic\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + K` for a Link\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + H` for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)\\n\\nWith just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.\\n\\n\\n## Inserting images\\n\\nImages in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:\\n\\n`![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)`\\n\\n![Computer](https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg)\\n\\nMost Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.\\n\\n_**Important Note:** Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files **before** uploading them to Ghost._\\n\\n\\n## Making lists\\n\\nLists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use `*` or `-` or `+`. Like this:\\n\\n1. Crack the eggs over a bowl\\n2. Whisk them together\\n3. Make an omellete\\n\\nor\\n\\n- Remember to buy milk\\n- Feed the cat\\n- Come up with idea for next story\\n\\n\\n## Adding quotes\\n\\nWhen you want to pull out a particularly good except in the middle of a piece, you can use `>` at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.\\n\\n> A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made\\n\\nAll themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.\\n\\n\\n## Dividing things up\\n\\nIf you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need.

In our Portfolio you will find all the work we\nshipped [/news/news/tag/portfolio/]  over the years.\n\nOur YouTube Channel\n\nWhat they said:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThanks to play-with-ghost [http://play-with-ghost.com/]  I finally understand\nhow easy it is to manage a website and be in control of my destiny on the web. I\ncould see thru Martine Nadal' showcase how I could build on my own. To all folks\nfrom play-with-ghost, thank you soo much! You guys rocks :-p\n\n\n— Daniela Elaberg | Read more [https://twitter.com/askpascalandy]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThis platform plus hard work on your content is a game changer. Now it's fun to\npublish something. Woot! woot!\n\n\n— David Morisson | Read more [https://twitter.com/askpascalandy]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI had a website running on Wordpress for years. I thought I was just plain\nstupid at running this site by myself. Thanks to Ghost, now I know I was wrong!\nPlease keep up to good work!\n\n\n— Julia Berry Showe | Read more [https://twitter.com/askpascalandy]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI was looking for a solution to break free of the Facebook ecosystem. My friend\nconvinced me that Myspace was the hot thing once and then... it was not. After\nhaving tried few website builders, I decided I start my home on the web with\nGhost. It just works and I never have to deal with fighting against styling\nthanks to markdown.
