Enjoy!\n\n### Preview albums from one page\n\nCreating a preview is the action of aggregating, \"to combine\" or to put things together.\n\nWhen you have many-many-many photos and albums it's a great idea to create **previews** and aggregate your albums into one place. You could have one main page ([like this one](/pictures-and-albums/)) where your visitor can preview a picture of each of your albums. \n\nThe same concept apply for videos or podcast. A great example is how Tim Ferris does it for it's [Podcast page](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/).\n\nAt the end, the whole idea is to create a natural flow that is it naturel to navigate.\n\nTo learn how create a link on a picture, go to:\n\n- http://blog.firepress.org/learn/\n- Lesson #1\n- Clickable image\n\n---\n\n> **Sara's note** — The [content](https://github.com/firepress-org/themes-content) on this page is an example, an opinionated way you could put your content together. See it as a demo. Edit it or delete it and start over. Make it your own!\n\n---\n\n## Tags\n\nA more advanced concept is to use tags. Maybe you want to filter the way we see your work by \n\n- #years\n- #country\n- #style *(i.e. fashion, events,  sports)*\n- #agencies\n- etc.\n\nTag allows you to create a feed about a particular topic.\n\nIn some case I would use both so there is two ways to search your albums. See how Pascal [use this concept](http://blog.pascalandy.com/trouver-par-tags/) on his personal blog.","html":"<p>During my last trip around the world, I capture few pictures. Here are my favorites!

Enjoy!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previewalbumsfromonepage\">Preview albums from one page</h3>\n\n<p>Creating a preview is the action of aggregating, \"to combine\" or to put things together.</p>\n\n<p>When you have many-many-many photos and albums it's a great idea to create <strong>previews</strong> and aggregate your albums into one place. You could have one main page (<a href=\"/pictures-and-albums/\">like this one</a>) where your visitor can preview a picture of each of your albums. </p>\n\n<p>The same concept apply for videos or podcast. A great example is how Tim Ferris does it for it's <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/\">Podcast page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At the end, the whole idea is to create a natural flow that is it naturel to navigate.</p>\n\n<p>To learn how create a link on a picture, go to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.firepress.org/learn/\">http://blog.firepress.org/learn/</a></li>\n<li>Lesson #1</li>\n<li>Clickable image</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Sara's note</strong> — The <a href=\"https://github.com/firepress-org/themes-content\">content</a> on this page is an example, an opinionated way you could put your content together. See it as a demo. Edit it or delete it and start over. Make it your own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"tags\">Tags</h2>\n\n<p>A more advanced concept is to use tags. Maybe you want to filter the way we see your work by </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>#years</li>\n<li>#country</li>\n<li>#style <em>(i.e. fashion, events,  sports)</em></li>\n<li>#agencies</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tag allows you to create a feed about a particular topic.</p>\n\n<p>In some case I would use both so there is two ways to search your albums. See how Pascal <a href=\"http://blog.pascalandy.com/trouver-par-tags/\">use this concept</a> on his personal blog.</p>","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firepress-org/themes-content/master/112_readiness/images/header-album.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":3,"created_at":"2016-07-18T01:36:56.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-08-04T03:25:20.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-07-09T01:55:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null},{"id":7,"uuid":"e8c2b714-1c63-4a9b-809e-4439e0672558","title":"Testimonials","slug":"testimonials","markdown":"This is what ***he*** and ***she*** said:\n\n> What can I say that's not been said about Nadine ?
