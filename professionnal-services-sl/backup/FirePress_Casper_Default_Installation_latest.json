It's a big day for you and I want to congratulate you because... **your website is online** 👌. I setup and preconfigured your website so you can quickly see how it feels. Sounds fair enough?\n\nYou will see I carefully edited the content with elements you expect to see within a `Stage 2` website. Things like:\n\n- Titles, links, bold, italic, etc.\n- Pictures in the headers of each post & page\n- Picture within a post & page\n- Embed YouTube videos\n- Embed animated GIF\n- Organize the navigation (menu)\n\nSo go for it and **take a moment to surf on your new website**! You will find these posts & pages:\n\n1. Your awesome website is ready\n2. Pictures and albums\n3. Services\n4. Contact\n5. About me\n6. Biography\n7. Testimonials\n\n**So tell me... how does it feel**?\n\n--- \n\n## One step a time\n\nWhen I setup your website, **I left out many elements** that could be included on your website. **I made this decision not to overwhelm you**. When you are ready to move on to a `Stage 2` website, you will be able to do fancy things like:\n\n- Edit SEO for you content\n- Tables (basic)\n- Pricing tables\n- Embed elements like audio, slides, pdf, download links, e-commerce, online payment, etc. (You can see a Youtube embed in page Biography)\n- Code injection and what you do with it\n- Create and manage a mailing list\n- Google Analytics\n- Using a form directly on Contact page\n- etc.\n\nTo conclude on this point, **here is my advice**: take it one step at a time. Don't rush things. Becoming a publisher and **running a website that acts like your impresario** it not a small task. It's a mindset that takes time even for great marketers. For now, don't worry about all options.\n\n---\n\n## Start your journey here\n\nAs a **publisher**, you need to get familiar about editing and posting content on your site. We carefully prepared a [**step-by-step checklist**](http://blog.firepress.org/learn/) to develop your skills at your own pace.\n\n[**blog.firepress.org/learn**](http://blog.firepress.org/learn/)\n\n---\n\n### Need help?\n\nAt FirePress, we do everything we can to make your \"onboarding experience\" a great one. **If something is not clear**, please reply to the welcome email we sent you before.\n\nCheers!<br>Sara<br>","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Hey there, I'm Sara!
